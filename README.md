### Erik’s Scripts
* `b` — lists all git branches in order of last edited. `b 1` switches to branch 1. `b clean 3+` deletes all branches from 3 or earlier.
* `fixup` — adds all changes to the last commit and force pushes it
* `lnks` — show which Node modules are linked with yalc
* `main` — print out the main branch (either main, master, or dev)
* `push` — pushes any new commits
* `rc` — continues the current rebase, checking for unmerged changes first
* `redact` — run a command with various strings redacted
* `this` — print the current branch name
* `update` — rebase the current branch on the latest changes on the remote main branch
